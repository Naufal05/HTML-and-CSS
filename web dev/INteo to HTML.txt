1. intro with HTML
	Web dev
	Front and Back technologies
	Web page working
	tnro to HTML
	Concept - HTML elements and tags.
	HTML attribute.
	BAsic structure of HTML
	  - head
	  - body
	  - title
	Basic tags used in HTML


*****Web Development*******
It is a project accesbile through internet.
This project is made up of FE, BE and Database.

Interface - is Front end or GUI.
code = logic + Data
Logic as backend
Data - Database

eg: Bank ATM's

FRONT END TECHNOLOGY
 
 Markup language is used to build the interface
 The most widely used markup language is called as
 HTML.
 HTML is very static in nature.

Static -> there is no communication between the user
 	and the web project.

Dynamic -> there is communication b/w user and the web project.

Inorder to make it more dynamic, Javascript was introcued.

CSS - was introduced to add styles.
 CSS framewroks :
	Bootstrap, Tailwind, MAterial UI etc.

	Initially JS was tilted towards procedure oriented language (less featured),
 but later 2005, js was tilted towards object orinted language (more featured).
 Complex dynamic websites was possible.

After 2005, developers started to creats library, a slection of process
which performs specific tsks for reusing them.

Libraries eg: Ajax, jquery etc

More ibraries were created, these libs are combined,
and they are called as frameworks.
	-Anugular
	-React
	-Vue
	etc......


BACK END TECHNOLGIES
  
  To create a logic you need a programming language.
Before 2005, java, python, .NET, PHP etc.
Since 2005 Javascript also started.

 Java -> Springboot(framweok)
 Python-> Django, flask 
 PHP-> Laravel, Codeignitor
 Javacript -> Nodejs
 
 Nodejs -> 
	
Google made V8 engine Open source. This is Google Chrome Browers Javascript compiler.

ECMA - European Computer Manufacturing Association
     - ECMA script based on which our brower will support.
     - JS is dervied from ECMA script

All the browers in the entire world support JS. But to support this
the brower should have a compiler

JS compiler (V8 egniner)+ Add some libraries = Noedjs 

Nodejs - is a runtime environment which is used to exectute JS.

  Express JS -> framework used on top of Nodejs.
  eg: 10 lines in Nodejs and 3 lines in expressjs

MERN 
 -mongodb/mysql express react Nodejs

 REact - VDOM
  -> react is actually a library,but it has the power to convert itself inot a framework by addign libraries together.

MEAN 
 - Mysql and mongodb
 - ExpressJS
 - Angular - uses MVM, Typescript
 - Nodejs

Promise feature is used to overcome the single thread issue.
Promise is an asynchronous 

DATABASES
- SQL bases
   - Relational DB
   - Table like structure
   eg: sql, oracle db, mariadb, mysql etc....
- NoSQL
   - Document Like structure
   - Non Relational Db
   eg: MongoDB, Cassandra, etc...


HOW DOES WEB DEVELOPMENT WORKS?

- User - Browser - Front End
  Client 
- Server - Backend + Database

 Request and Response

Evolution of Internet:
 - 1960's - US Army - had military bases all over the world, 
   they wanted to communicate with the bases. For that they
   connected all these bases together, this create a private network.
   Netowkr is the collection of nodes.

 - in 1980's - Insurance companies /banks/ Educational institutions
	all these branches were created.

-  In 1990's - a new n/w was created which was public in nature
   called as INTERNET.
   PRotocol - It is a chaneel created between the sender
              and receiverto pass the messages.
	- HTTP protocol - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
		request -> HTTP message
		response-> HTML document.


INTRODUCTION TO HTML

- Hyper Text MArkup Language - Frontend markup lang to create static documents.

Tags: 
 - is a basic unit of HTML.
  eg: <p>, <h1> etc...

Element: 
 - element is collection of 3 important units, namely:
	1. Opening tag
	2. closing tag
	3. Content
  eg: <p> content </p>

HTML Basic structure

HTML Attributes
 - are used to manipulate the properties of a HTML element.
 - should be enclosed inside the opening tag of the element.

Basic Tags used in HTML :
-p
-h1, h2 h3 h4 h5 and h6

=====================================================
HTML -ll
===================================================
Agenda :
1. HTML Tables
2. HTML Forms
3. Semantic HTML

HTML is the primary building block. IT creates
a structure for you.

SGML - Standard General Markup Language.
SGML (standard generalized markup language) is an international standard 
for the definition of markup languages; that is, it is a metalanguage. 
Markup consists of notations called tags that specify the function of 
a piece of text or how it is to be displayed.

What is property?
Diff b/w attributes and property ?

* HTML Tables

-<table> </table> -> table element
-<thrad> </thead>
-<tr> </tr> - table rows
- <th> </th> - Heading
-<td> </td> - table data

Every browser is having its own style sheet.
	
td - 

rowspan and colspan - help to manage the spacing that is available in
			current table structure.

Cellspacing* and Cellpadding* - these are the basic attribute.

(check the datatablejs.com to learn more about tables).

---------------
HTML Forms
---------------
help us to capture the data from the user input from any time.

Validation of the form is the backbone.

Form is a container tag - <form> </form>

	<form name="Registration Form" action="" method="get">
		<input name="fname" type="text" />
		<input type="text" name="lname" />
	//action is sort of the attribute that keeps
	the information of the url page of the server
	which will receive the information of th form 
	and process it.
	//method

	</form>
